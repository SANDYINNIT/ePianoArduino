# What is this?

Here you can find the code of the project we used which can be found here:
https://github.com/SANDYINNIT/ePiano

# Will it work 100%?

Maybe, if you structure the piano just like how we'd done it then it might work, but if you use different buttons, different wires places, mess with it then you'll need to modify it and for help we'd be available to help you!
